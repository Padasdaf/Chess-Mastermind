# Chess Mastermind
A web-based chess application featuring a decision-making chess bot, currently a work in progress! The bot uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to simulate competitive moves. This project explores strategic decision-making in game development, with future updates planned to improve the bot’s evaluation function and overall gameplay depth. The project aims to enhance the player experience by refining the bot’s strategic capabilities and interactive elements.
